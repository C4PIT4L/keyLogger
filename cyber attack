    FIRST OF ALL:
SQL Injection:

if you type in the code the name of the username' OR '1'='1', i will return TRUE so it will log you in

USE THIS TO TRY:

email: 123' OR '1'='1
Password: NO MATTER WHAT

SERVER OUTPUT: SELECT * from Users where email='123' OR '1'='1' and password='c1a5298f939e87e8f962a5edfc206918'
1. IS YOUR EMAIL 123 AND YOUR PASSWORD IS 834: Answer: NO
2. IS YOUR EMAIL 123 OR 1=1 ANSWER: YES
3. LOGIN

another method:
SELECT * from Users where email='123'-- 'and password='2ffe4e77325d9a7152f7086ea7aa5114'

in this method the -- means comment, so it just gonna ask IS your email 123 if so you log in

Dictionary ATTACK:
using a file with lots of password and run this file to try to hack into the system

BRUTE FORCE ATTACK:
By adding log monitor system i can detect when a user use brute force attack.

Man in the middle attack:
Using SSL to secure the connection between the client/server
